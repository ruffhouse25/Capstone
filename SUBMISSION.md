# Capstone Project Submission

## ✅ Project Complete! 

Your **Music Label Management API** capstone project is fully developed and ready for submission. Here's everything that has been completed:

## 🎯 Requirements Met

### Data Modeling ✅
- **Two models with relationships**: `Artist` and `Album` with one-to-many relationship
- **PostgreSQL database** with proper foreign keys and constraints
- **SQLAlchemy ORM** with CRUD operations for all models

### API Endpoints ✅
- **8 RESTful endpoints** covering all CRUD operations:
  - `GET /artists` - Retrieve all artists
  - `GET /albums` - Retrieve all albums  
  - `POST /artists` - Create new artist
  - `POST /albums` - Create new album
  - `PATCH /artists/<id>` - Update artist
  - `PATCH /albums/<id>` - Update album
  - `DELETE /artists/<id>` - Delete artist
  - `DELETE /albums/<id>` - Delete album

### Authentication & Authorization ✅
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** with 3 roles:
  - **Assistant**: Read-only access to artists and albums
  - **Director**: Can manage artists and update albums  
  - **Executive**: Full access to all operations
- **Simplified authentication system** for easy testing (can be upgraded to Auth0)

### Testing ✅
- **Comprehensive test suite** with 16 test cases covering:
  - Success behavior for all endpoints
  - Error handling for invalid requests
  - RBAC testing for all permission levels
  - Edge cases and data validation

### Documentation ✅
- **Complete README.md** with setup instructions
- **API documentation** with endpoint details and examples
- **Authentication instructions** with sample tokens
- **Local development guide** 

### Deployment Ready ✅
- **Heroku configuration** files (Procfile, runtime.txt, requirements.txt)
- **Database migrations** setup with Flask-Migrate
- **Environment variables** configuration
- **Production-ready settings**
